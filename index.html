    <h2 itemprop="headline">Hello! I'm Tim Lim and this is my personal web page.</h2>
    <p>I enjoy creating things from scratch (cooking, writing, coding), making myself better, and learning new things.  Recently, I have loved learning new skills like scuba diving, skiing, and dancing. I enjoy working out and managing my diet, and I love trying out new hobbies and sports.  I've rediscovered my passion for reading and have been reading at least a book a week.
